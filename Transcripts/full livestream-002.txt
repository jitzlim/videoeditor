00:00:00:00 - 00:01:15:00
Unknown
Oh.

00:01:15:02 - 00:01:22:07
Unknown
Oh.

00:01:22:09 - 00:02:14:22
Unknown
Oh!

00:02:14:24 - 00:02:40:01
Unknown
Hey, what is up, everybody? My name is Ryan, on the camera from long. And today, I'm going to be interviewing three different teams from the British American ecosystem. Yeah. Super exciting teams working on the frontier of prediction markets. So, yeah, before we get started, there is, just one more thing. So in previous sessions, we've gone right into founders.

00:02:40:11 - 00:03:02:28
Unknown
Today I'd like to talk a little bit about lung. We're a launchpad, and we are currently looking for, founders on the base blockchain, or any EVM chain who are interested in, launching a token. So if that sounds interesting, and if your team is looking for launch token, feel free to reach out to me, at Giga Rahul on X.

00:03:03:00 - 00:03:24:29
Unknown
So, let's get right into it. First off, we have George from Function Space. How are you doing today? Hey, Rahul, it's great to be here. It's going good. How are you? I'm doing great, man. I'm glad you're here. So, we can get right into it, man. Function space is doing some really cool stuff.

00:03:25:29 - 00:03:46:12
Unknown
Yeah. Tell us about it. Awesome, awesome. Well. Hello, everyone. It's a great pleasure. An honor to be here, with Rahul, at long. So I am, my name is George RSA. I am, research engineer at function space. Today. I am, representing, the team. Most of them are based in Australia, so it's like 3 a.m. for them.

00:03:46:13 - 00:04:08:21
Unknown
So I'm very happy that I was able to, join you guys. And from, let's say, the, the research engineering perspective to a little bit more about our function space. So yeah, I'd like to tell you a little bit more about, first of all, the, say, our current vision of the space, the prediction market space and then some of the problems and some of the opportunities for growth we see and how we mean to address them.

00:04:09:09 - 00:04:50:18
Unknown
And seize the opportunity to build. So if you start, if we start by looking at the current landscape of prediction markets, through, let's say, an engineering and design lens, our thesis is that right now for, let's say, 99% of prediction market projects you see out there, they are building some sort of application, some sort of, consumer facing product that is a little bit like you know, untrained and untrained casino of sorts, or like a platform for people to, well, speculate, predict exactly, things with their beliefs.

00:04:50:18 - 00:05:09:00
Unknown
Right? Yes. But we're not seeing this from the point of view of like necessarily that they are encouraging gambling or anything like that, but more so in terms of like the architectural vices that they are inheriting from this, let's say app or like even casino sports with faith based approach. Let's break it down into like a few categories of where the problems are.

00:05:09:02 - 00:05:28:15
Unknown
The first one we see is there's, gatekeeping and centralization behind market creation. So you get a handful of platforms with the sort of like veto or whitelisting, rights or privileges that decide what can be listed because of applications, playing this role of, well, consumer facing apps, they are forced actually to be gatekeepers in a sense.

00:05:28:15 - 00:05:53:11
Unknown
Right. And then you have whoever's in charge of product that these, applications, they will get to decide what gets this gets listed and what doesn't. And then this close or this centralization actually prevents a lot of the signal that could be surfaced by prediction markets from, making it out in the open. So let's go through a crazy example, I guess.

00:05:53:13 - 00:06:11:23
Unknown
Now imagine like a Dao, for example. But they want to hedge their treasury against a specific supply chain disruption, something like, let's say, a semiconductor shortage that is affecting, either an industry or a partner. Well, this is a valid risk, but maybe it's not the kind of thing that people are thinking of on a day to day basis.

00:06:11:23 - 00:06:28:17
Unknown
Right? So you go to a current market leader and to try to list it, it might not gain as much traction because it's not the most vital thing. Right? It might be something very relevant, might be something that surfaces a lot of signal about how it where the world is going, but it's not immediately viral. It's not going to generate clicks by retail.

00:06:28:17 - 00:06:51:23
Unknown
And so you have a risk or even like an information, let's say vector that remains on price. And then that sort of capital is going to remain on the sidelines. Yeah. And it doesn't have the liquidity in order to, make the market viable from it. Right. Exactly, exactly. And there's a whole set of problems with that, which is exactly what I'm what I'm leading into next to appreciate the colander.

00:06:51:26 - 00:07:16:02
Unknown
Precisely. The next problem with, let's say, even if you were to somehow decentralize or make it more open, how markets get generated, the issue of fragmentation of liquidity and how outcomes are accrued are also a problem in prediction markets. By the way, we're going through a high level overview of the problems. And then we're going to like put them all together into like a single thread of how we see onto the space we're going to be solving them.

00:07:16:05 - 00:07:40:17
Unknown
So this is the second we want to touch upon. So when you look at how prediction markets currently work, just like the first, the first problem was was what exactly fragmentation of liquidity. And then the second problem is what? No, the first problem is the gatekeeping and centralization behind market creation. That is something that incentivizes that. They have the centralized, they create the markets, right?

00:07:40:20 - 00:07:59:07
Unknown
Correct. And this and this is something that makes a lot of sense when you think about you're dealing with apps for consumers, that have to be gatekeeper somehow. And you're not dealing with really like some sort of like a more underlying or decentralized infrastructure layer, like, for example, a blockchain where anyone can come and build whatever applications they want.

00:07:59:09 - 00:08:29:06
Unknown
Just I'm actually can think that some of what we want to do later, but yeah, first of all would be that the, get it in centralized market creation. Yeah. And for the second problem, let's talk about the fragmentation of liquidity and how outcomes tend to be crude when you're dealing with prediction markets. So even with a market does get listed, you'll see, for example, let's say users want to hedge their risk or they want to can bid on information or beliefs about the price of bitcoin, let's say.

00:08:29:06 - 00:08:51:09
Unknown
Right. So on current platforms, for the most part, you don't really get an underlying market that talks about the price of Bitcoin as a whole. You get these bunch of buckets like okay we'll between B above 90 K will it be about 95 K. And you get yes. No. Binary outcomes for all of those with the corresponding liquidity fragmentation that ensues this that that making sense so far.

00:08:51:11 - 00:09:15:09
Unknown
Right. So you're saying like there aren't arbitrary price distinctions. It's like you get to choose between these, various like, ranges that are pre-selected for you. Exactly. So it's sort of like this binary. Yes. No structure that has been wildly successful with, you know, in common layers like the market and the like, which, is for sure very effective.

00:09:15:09 - 00:09:34:26
Unknown
And it has a very strong place and available position for these sort of binary questions. But then this model tries to be like shoehorned in into more complex, let's say, assertions you want to make around the world about the world, such as something like the realization of a continuous variable like the price of bitcoin, right? It's like, where do you draw the lines?

00:09:35:03 - 00:10:00:12
Unknown
How do you design these boxes? And then how do you make it expressive enough? Yeah, people from various backgrounds, various levels of technical numerical sophistication to be able to convey the risk or like their rather dour assertions about the world on a single platform. Yeah. So this discretize this capital and what would potentially be a very deep ocean of liquidity that you could tap into.

00:10:00:14 - 00:10:16:13
Unknown
And that should exist. Like there's a lot of people who are interested in the price of Bitcoin and want to hedge against it and something like that. Like the risks behind this, it's it's action. Then it's just partition into like a bunch of tiny puddles, leading to like a very bad user experience. And just like a lack of synergy in how the market operates.

00:10:16:19 - 00:10:37:07
Unknown
Right. And you can see they are both kind of intertwined when you have like this model of you have a bunch of apps, they are, you have these walled gardens. Everyone is building their own thing, kind of like in a, this coordinated fashion. It sort of naturally leads to this equivalent fragmentation in a sense. Yeah. For sure.

00:10:37:09 - 00:10:57:25
Unknown
Well, these are the two of the, I'm curious to hear. So, Yeah. No, let's let's just get right into it. Yeah. Share your screen. Let's take a look at the website to see what you're building to solve this. That sounds great. So, yes, having set up a review of the space, let's move on to like how we see function space, can innovate to resolve some of these points of friction.

00:10:57:27 - 00:11:19:21
Unknown
So I'm going to share my screen. I'll leave you with function space, not death. Currently working on the website. There's a lot more to come here. So I would, ask you guys to stay tuned as we, add more, but, hey, information and visuals about what we're doing here and also like on our Twitter as well, research.

00:11:19:24 - 00:11:46:18
Unknown
So let's see, I'd like to show some visuals about actually might come to this one later. I'm going to start with the one on the bottom. Yeah. So what function space is. It's a protocol. Which we are aiming to build on chain so that this execution is also quite heavily neutral function space. It's a protocol and a platform that allows other developers to build their own prediction applications.

00:11:47:18 - 00:12:14:13
Unknown
On top of function space in other words, we have a protocol plus as key and not just an isolated application. And so with the core engineer function space rather that, what it's going to allow you to do is rather than resolving around narrow or discretize outcomes, like let's say, and I'm going to get to that or the meaning behind this sort of like curve that you see here with what I'm going to say next.

00:12:14:15 - 00:12:38:03
Unknown
So instead of having these like bucket like, let's say model for how predictions mark markets work, we are aiming to unlock something a lot more expressive where anyone, any sort of trader, can submit a full probability distribution over how they expect a certain event to resolve. So let me be a little bit more specific about what I mean with this.

00:12:38:03 - 00:13:02:22
Unknown
And this is sort of like what this curve is getting at, right? Let's say for example, imagine this is the price of gold in thousands of dollars, right? So let's say you want to make a bid on what will the price of gold be, let's say by a certain date. Right. Do you see it as being $3,000, $4,000, $5,000?

00:13:03:27 - 00:13:21:13
Unknown
Normally you just have to, like, choose some arbitrary boundary and be done with it and say, yes, it's going to be below this or no, it's going to be above this, but with function space. By allowing traders to submit full probability distributions, we can allow them to say like, okay, let's say I think it's going to be $3,000.

00:13:21:13 - 00:13:43:06
Unknown
With a certain degree of probability, I think it's gonna be $4,000 with a certainty probability you can convey like the full, let's say, breakdown of how you expect. What are the chances that you see for each of these outcomes to hold. And then for a continuous variable and there's a tiny mathematical caveat here. I guess for the, for the mathematically, inclined audience.

00:13:43:11 - 00:14:01:11
Unknown
Other we have a continuous variable. You don't really have these tiny buckets. You have what is known as a probability density function. But it's essentially a curve where the intuitive meaning is that. Right? It's sort of like conveying what are the odds, in a sense, of each of these outcomes that may come to pass, to happen.

00:14:01:13 - 00:14:22:08
Unknown
Are you saying, does this have to do with the, resolution of the market, or are you still talking about placing, like, bids? No, this is about the bid. The resolution is it's a separate matter. It's about when you're bidding on something rather than saying a binary yes or no, you're allowed to, let's say,

00:14:22:10 - 00:14:52:27
Unknown
Okay. Yeah. I see a 10% probability for this, price point, 20% probability for this price point, so on and so forth. Right. Yeah. So it's a lot of betting in ranges. And you could do this on Poly Market, but you wouldn't get the granularity of like the the curve here where you could bet like you know $1,000 on Bitcoin being above 85,000 and then maybe like 5000 on being above like, 80,000 and then maybe like some other amount, less or higher or whatever.

00:14:52:27 - 00:15:16:06
Unknown
Right. Just kind of like to get, the full cat like, capture fully like where your beliefs lie. But here you get to do that with one system and capture your whole kind of, perspective of how what the what the probabilities are going to be over, over the odds. That's exactly right. And I'm just being conscious of finally just drive this home with a final point.

00:15:16:08 - 00:15:44:26
Unknown
Yeah. This is the underlying engine for function space, and it's fully sophisticated and allowing people to deal with probability density functions. This is more and this is going to be a special interest for the developer building the application or word or whatever prediction market products they have to bits. But for the user, for the user, who faces the applications, you can abstract away as much of this liquid, of this complexity as you would like, or you can keep it as complex as you would like.

00:15:44:29 - 00:15:48:10
Unknown
So, for example.

00:15:48:12 - 00:16:16:20
Unknown
With a fully expressive, a PDF or a probability density function paradigm like this one, you can basically state any sort of assertion around how you see, an outcome of the price of gold, two results you can have. Let's say you do an application where people are saying like, oh, it's going to be exactly $3,000. And I want to like put all my liquidity on saying that the price of gold is going to be very close to $3,000, and that's going to be like a very sort of like in the function space.

00:16:16:20 - 00:16:47:29
Unknown
That's going to look like a very sharp, sort of like beat that is center around that, number. But you can have, let's say, more risk averse. For example, institutions who they want to hedge a little bit more and say, like, okay, we think it's going to be between 3000 and $4000. And then it will be sort of a curve that looks like, you know, like a more kind of like a hat in function space where it's like, okay, I think it's gonna be between here and here, but I don't really have much certainty about where it's going to be in your honor.

00:16:48:01 - 00:17:31:29
Unknown
Right. Exactly. But then what you're doing is you're taking all of these isolated markets, which are all valid user applications, that they're all of interest to the user, but you're casting them all onto the same back end that is has the full fine, the full mathematical expressivity to translate all of those questions to like a common engine, and then you're pulling all the liquidity into a single mechanism, and then what you're doing is you're by taking all of these signals about the world, maybe the regions talking, it might be little institutions talking, it might be different types of traders with different types of profiles of, let's say risk aversion, sophistication, or even

00:17:31:29 - 00:17:50:00
Unknown
like early, alpha on how they see the market is going to behave. You're taking all of that, you're aggregating it into a single engine, you're joining the liquidity, and you are creating this consensus curve that you see this market consensus curve that you see here, that is.

00:17:50:03 - 00:18:31:14
Unknown
A much more, let's say, granular interpretation of what the market believes, about a certain event and how it's going to happen. Right. And then this information like that and like a hypothetical probability distribution, exactly. The outcome. Exactly, exactly. So, you know, the the end goal, let's say I would argue for prediction markets is to be become a valuable instrument to surface information about the world, right, to surface a certain consensus, to incentivize people who have a deep understanding about an event and how it might resolve, to signal this information out in the open.

00:18:31:16 - 00:19:09:24
Unknown
And then instead of, like, keeping it in the current crude fashion of like a binary bunch of buckets, you are able to generate, like a full on probability distribution of how the market expects things to behave. And this is a very, very valuable signal for understanding the world. Yeah. We call this, we call this property by the name of belief, composability, the fact that you can have all of these people from different backgrounds, from different interests in a certain particular event, make wildly different, bits about how a certain event is going to result.

00:19:09:27 - 00:19:43:14
Unknown
You're able to cast them all onto the same back end, have things that would normally be assertions that would normally be incompatible with each other, now be compatible and become part of a single source of liquidity. And so you are able to and this is what we mean with belief composability that then you're able to aggregate all of this information into the same place and unlock all of these benefits for traders, builders and people who are using prediction markets as information instruments alike.

00:19:43:16 - 00:20:04:13
Unknown
Yeah, that's that's awesome man. Yeah, it's very cool. So you mentioned this is for developers, right? So can I, can I expect to see this on Poly Market or call C or some other kind of like market soon. Anything that works, right. For, for function space, we're actually, building it has its own independent infrastructure layer.

00:20:04:20 - 00:20:20:06
Unknown
Okay. So we're going to have a protocol. We're going to have an on chain implementation. And we're going to have its own SDK. Awesome. It is we're going to expect to or our goal is to bring developers to function space directly. Gotcha. In order to build on top of our protocol segment. That's, super exciting.

00:20:21:06 - 00:20:43:05
Unknown
Yeah. I think, it's a really interesting concept, and I'd love to, like, personally trade on it because I think, it's it's just really exciting. It's sick. So, thanks for coming on. I would love to have you on, another time. Like, once you have this, like, live and running and we can actually, like, share what it's like, but this is all super early.

00:20:43:12 - 00:21:02:09
Unknown
Alpha. Yes. So. Yeah. Excited to have you back. Whenever you're ready to present the demo. Thank you so much. We're working hard over the next few weeks, to live our demo, and we'll definitely be in touch. So stay tuned. Everyone follow us on, on Twitter, as function space. And we really. Well, thank you for the time.

00:21:02:09 - 00:21:17:06
Unknown
And we hope to be, on stage soon. Again, thank you so much, Rahul, for the opportunity. It was great to have you. Thanks for being on the show. I'll see you around.

00:21:17:09 - 00:21:30:04
Unknown
Okay. Next up, we have outcome markets. Hey, you there. Hello. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. MiG, is it?

00:21:30:07 - 00:22:02:28
Unknown
Yeah, yeah, you can call me by MiG. Okay. Well, yeah. Thanks for being in the show. I would love to. Kind of, like, learn more about, outcome markets. Like, what's your kind of, elevator pitch here? So basically, outcome markets is a decentralized prediction hosted on, the hyper EVM. Oh, but the, upper market is to, for high frequency trading, for prediction markets.

00:22:03:00 - 00:22:34:13
Unknown
It's, built in mind for traders, and it's built with a user interface of a professional trading terminal, but also very, beginner friendly. And on top of that, we've kind of created a to our core product, which is leverage prediction markets, which we are deploying those contracts on the hyper liquid. It predicts this is sick.

00:22:34:24 - 00:22:55:14
Unknown
I actually this is the first time I'm hearing of a high frequency trading prediction market focused trading terminal. So I'm really curious to see how you guys are approaching that. Yeah. You want to share your screen? Yeah. Screen.

00:22:55:16 - 00:23:28:08
Unknown
So we're currently in, in testnet, kind of, what people will get to experience when it goes to, to kind of main net, do is we host contracts based off data feeds. So every contract that we can create is based off a verifiable source we do not rely on. Everything is, data related. So if the data says that the contract has resolved, then we resolve it auto, automatically.

00:23:28:10 - 00:23:57:11
Unknown
The whole process is autonomous, so there's no human input. And it's all unchecked. So it's all perf verifiable. In terms of the going. So, yeah. Like what's your what's your source for the data? So we use Pip for the trust, DeFi contracts and for sports we use, Sports Monks, which is a dedicated, soccer sports provider.

00:23:57:13 - 00:24:28:14
Unknown
Core. But the sports in terms of soccer or football of, say it. We'll be adding like support for NFL, NBA, college football and golf, F1, UFC, pretty much every single sport you can think of will be supported eventually. I think there's a ton of demand for that. So yeah that's awesome. Yeah. So I.

00:24:28:16 - 00:24:56:08
Unknown
Yeah, I'll just give a quick, continuation. So like this two kind of different types of contracts right now. One is the sports contracts and the other is the Trump plan D5 contracts. If I go to a, D5 contract, you'll see that it's. It's I'm not sure why it's taking some time. Yeah. So it's it's built similar to a kind of Dex, like, user interface.

00:24:56:11 - 00:25:18:24
Unknown
So users can easily, pick and go through the different type of contracts with a dropdown menu where you can, you know, filter for exactly what you want. You can check the asset price, regarding the condition of that contract. So for example, this is the Ethereum contract. Would it trade below. So then you can go down and see the strike price.

00:25:18:24 - 00:25:52:26
Unknown
So you're always aware and you can see in real time, of market conditions compared to that strike price. This is where the all the work is currently. What we, we, we come from a market making background. So we created our own market making, our own property market making strategies. What currently in all markets ourselves over like, system where users can also deploy, you know, stable, stable yield on the market.

00:25:54:16 - 00:26:05:22
Unknown
The rest is, is, like a trading terminal you can buy, your positions will all appear at the bottom. Have,

00:26:05:24 - 00:26:31:05
Unknown
You can see, you know, you can see your open orders. Your trade history and outcome is where the contracts resolve the resolve contracts where you can claim all of your resolved contract. And this is like the trading activity of that contract. And, you know, just like on political culture, you can also, have some interaction with other users.

00:26:31:07 - 00:26:43:25
Unknown
Cool. Where the sort of, I just I'm just curious about the high frequency trading aspect. How do you incorporate that into the platform?

00:26:43:27 - 00:27:14:00
Unknown
So we build our own entire. But we are not just the front end. This is not, we're not show any poly or Kaushik. So we, built the, central limit order book and the matching engine logic. The HFT system mainly comes through, docs, where we're currently developing, API documentation so users can kind of deploy their own, strategies via, API trading and,

00:27:14:03 - 00:27:40:25
Unknown
Yeah. We will also add all arrangements in there as well. So the high frequency trading you mostly will be people doing API based trading. And we support it based off our, matching engine. Okay, cool. So, yeah, you're opening up this to, people running prediction market bots, people who want, to trade algorithmically, etc..

00:27:40:27 - 00:28:04:11
Unknown
Correct? Correct. Our primary goal is to ensure that there's high liquidity. So the goal is to ensure more liquidity. Then our prediction market. So people will come to outcome to trade size, but also algorithmic algorithmically at the same time. How are you, trying to get liquidity? I mean, currently we're using our own treasury.

00:28:04:25 - 00:28:25:27
Unknown
But we have our own, market making rebate program where people can, earn a rebates, depending, how much volume that they period. And based on that. So we're trying to achieve because when speaks with some big teams.

00:28:26:00 - 00:28:42:26
Unknown
You and we also, are currently using our own treasury. Sic yeah. That that's really great that you guys are in chat, chatting with, market makers and such. Do you want to cover the leverage, tab as well?

00:28:42:28 - 00:29:11:09
Unknown
Yeah. So it's completely in the demo mode right now because we have free decks. For for the clients that's listening out there for people to join. You know, give their inputs on, on the, on the decks side is we want the community involved in picking out all who we stake with, with the, with, the contracts that they would like us to do.

00:29:11:10 - 00:29:38:10
Unknown
We want it to be completely interactive with the community. So, at the moment, we this this is this completely demo, but the is what you decide in some of the system on the lever side, we've just, a clear indication indicator and you can pick up the ten times, ten x leverage. Sweet, sweet. I'm curious, what's your team's background?

00:29:38:14 - 00:29:43:14
Unknown
What are you guys doing before running? Outcome. Markets.

00:29:43:16 - 00:29:54:12
Unknown
Great question. So we we actually come from a mixed pattern to them. All the co-founders come from like a fintech background. And we also have,
