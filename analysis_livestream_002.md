*   **Hook Line**: "Instead of having these bucket-like models... we are aiming to unlock something a lot more expressive."
*   **Key Moments (Timestamps)**:
    *   `00:12:38`: "And this is sort of like what this curve is getting at, right? Let's say for example, imagine this is the price of gold in thousands of dollars, right? So let's say you want to make a bid on what will the price of gold be, let's say by a certain date." (Start)
    *   `00:13:03`: "Normally you just have to, like, choose some arbitrary boundary and be done with it and say, yes, it's going to be below this or no, it's going to be above this, but with function space. By allowing traders to submit full probability distributions, we can allow them to say like, okay, let's say I think it's going to be $3,000." (Peak - The Contrast)
    *   `00:13:21`: "With a certain degree of probability, I think it's gonna be $4,000 with a certainty probability you can convey like the full, let's say, breakdown of how you expect. What are the chances that you see for each of these outcomes to hold." (End)

    *   Text Overlay: **"Binary vs. Probability"**.
*   **Caption/Tweet**: "Prediction markets are evolving. No more simple 'Yes/No' bets. Imagine betting on the entire probability curve. 🧠📊 #DeFi #FunctionSpace #Trading"
